## Rules

- Group endpoints by project, then by controller/router.
- Derive from controller action methods, route attributes, minimal API mappings, Express/Fastify route handlers, FastAPI decorators.
- Include request and response payload types with field-level detail.
- If OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists (`swagger.json`, `openapi.yaml`), use it as the primary source.
- List all status codes the endpoint can return (derive from return statements, ProducesResponseType attributes, or OpenAPI spec).
- Note authentication requirements per endpoint (derive from [Authorize], middleware, route guards).
- For endpoints with path parameters, include them in the route (e.g., `/api/users/{id}`).
